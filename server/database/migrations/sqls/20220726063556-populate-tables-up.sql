Since its release in October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS. In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map.

During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team.

Since its release in October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.

During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team.

Since its release in October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS. In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a champion, with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team.

SKT vs KOO Finals S5 Worlds!","League of Legends, commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS. In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a champion, with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their Nexus.","Gaming",1651556885,1,23,"qIw8zpefgAgX1UpllrwSd","PiercewSdChannel","0","profilePlaceholder"),

Before I started I always thought of fencing as a sorta sword/medieval knights, pirates, etc. thing. But in time, and it didn't take long, I began to really think of it as its own thing. When I'm fencing, I don't think about swords and knights, I just..think of fencing, like its its own separate thing. It doesn't feel like medieval knights and stuff like that. It feels like..fencing. There's no real way to describe it, other than its a very technical, elegant sport. Almost arrogant one could say, in the style and grace fencers carry themselves with and the confidence. I'd say you're at less of a risk of getting seriously beaten up like in football or soccer, but unlike those sports I mean, when the signal to go happens, you go head on.

When I'm fencing, I don't think about swords and knights, I just..think of fencing, like its its own separate thing. It doesn't feel like medieval knights and stuff like that. It feels like..fencing. There's no real way to describe it, other than its a very technical, elegant sport. Almost arrogant one could say, in the style and grace fencers carry themselves with and the confidence.

Before I started I always thought of fencing as a sorta sword/medieval knights, pirates, etc. thing. But in time, and it didn't take long, I began to really think of it as its own thing. When I'm fencing, I don't think about swords and knights, I just..think of fencing, like its its own separate thing. It doesn't feel like medieval knights and stuff like that. It feels like..fencing. There's no real way to describe it, other than its a very technical, elegant sport. Almost arrogant one could say, in the style and grace fencers carry themselves with and the confidence. I'd say you're at less of a risk of getting seriously beaten up like in football or soccer, but unlike those sports I mean, when the signal to go happens, you go head on. You REALLY go after each other. I'd say its definitely more aggressive.","Sports",1651556885,1,59,"NnkysgsU0DalSpfy7VH-i","PierceH-iChannel","0","profilePlaceholder"),

There's no real way to describe it, other than its a very technical, elegant sport. Almost arrogant one could say, in the style and grace fencers carry themselves with and the confidence. I'd say you're at less of a risk of getting seriously beaten up like in football or soccer, but unlike those sports I mean, when the signal to go happens, you go head on. You REALLY go after each other. I'd say its definitely more aggressive.","Sports",1651556885,1,59,"tSieki4Q4qPDWt1uYLTiX","JonesTiXChannel","0","profilePlaceholder"),

There's no real way to describe it, other than its a very technical, elegant sport. Almost arrogant one could say, in the style and grace fencers carry themselves with and the confidence. I'd say you're at less of a risk of getting seriously beaten up like in football or soccer, but unlike those sports I mean, when the signal to go happens, you go head on.

Before I started I always thought of fencing as a sorta sword/medieval knights, pirates, etc. thing. But in time, and it didn't take long, I began to really think of it as its own thing. When I'm fencing, I don't think about swords and knights, I just..think of fencing, like its its own separate thing. It doesn't feel like medieval knights and stuff like that. It feels like..fencing. There's no real way to describe it, other than its a very technical, elegant sport. Almost arrogant one could say, in the style and grace fencers carry themselves with and the confidence. I'd say you're at less of a risk of getting seriously beaten up like in football or soccer, but unlike those sports I mean, when the signal to go happens, you go head on.

Before I started I always thought of fencing as a sorta sword/medieval knights, pirates, etc. thing. But in time, and it didn't take long, I began to really think of it as its own thing. When I'm fencing, I don't think about swords and knights, I just..think of fencing, like its its own separate thing. It doesn't feel like medieval knights and stuff like that. It feels like..fencing. There's no real way to describe it, other than its a very technical, elegant sport. Almost arrogant one could say, in the style and grace fencers carry themselves with and the confidence. I'd say you're at less of a risk of getting seriously beaten up like in football or soccer, but unlike those sports I mean, when the signal to go happens, you go head on.

When I'm fencing, I don't think about swords and knights, I just..think of fencing, like its its own separate thing. It doesn't feel like medieval knights and stuff like that. It feels like..fencing. There's no real way to describe it, other than its a very technical, elegant sport. Almost arrogant one could say, in the style and grace fencers carry themselves with and the confidence. I'd say you're at less of a risk of getting seriously beaten up like in football or soccer, but unlike those sports I mean, when the signal to go happens, you go head on.

Before I started I always thought of fencing as a sorta sword/medieval knights, pirates, etc. thing. But in time, and it didn't take long, I began to really think of it as its own thing. When I'm fencing, I don't think about swords and knights, I just..think of fencing, like its its own separate thing. It doesn't feel like medieval knights and stuff like that. It feels like..fencing. There's no real way to describe it, other than its a very technical, elegant sport. Almost arrogant one could say, in the style and grace fencers carry themselves with and the confidence. I'd say you're at less of a risk of getting seriously beaten up like in football or soccer, but unlike those sports I mean, when the signal to go happens, you go head on.

There's no real way to describe it, other than its a very technical, elegant sport. Almost arrogant one could say, in the style and grace fencers carry themselves with and the confidence. I'd say you're at less of a risk of getting seriously beaten up like in football or soccer, but unlike those sports I mean, when the signal to go happens, you go head on. You REALLY go after each other. I'd say its definitely more aggressive.","Sports",1651556885,1,59,"z9hDGLpHuD9scatORE4Rr","West4RrChannel","0","profilePlaceholder"),
